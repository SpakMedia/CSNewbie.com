## FAQ
**Q:** How do you want the content placed on the site? Links to PDFs, PDFs themselves, or links to where to buy the books? I have a ton of PDFs but not sure how you feel about posting free material online that authors would probably prefer be acquired through regular purchase

**A:** I think links to where to buy the books would be wise -- maybe a sentence or two as to why you liked it. As much as I love free info, I don't want to piss off people who worked hard on a product.
