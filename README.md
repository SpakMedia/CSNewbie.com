## FAQ
**Q:** How do you want the content placed on the site? Links to PDFs, PDFs themselves, or links to where to buy the books? I have a ton of PDFs but not sure how you feel about posting free material online that authors would probably prefer be acquired through regular purchase

**A:** I think links to where to buy the books would be wise -- maybe a sentence or two as to why you liked it. As much as I love free info, I don't want to piss off people who worked hard on a product.

## Affiliate Links & Advertising Disclaimer
In an effort to make Spak Media profitable we will occasionally convert resource links shared to affiliate links. <br>
<br>
Why? We want to grow the network via PPC advertising. Also, at scale we will need to invest more time into managing & organizing all Spak Media projects. Eventually we'd like to have a small dedicated team (5 - 10 people) of content editors & programmers that are paid to help us stay organized & moving forward.
